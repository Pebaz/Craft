Craft is an interpreted, high-level scripting language.







## Performance



It will be necessary to port as much of the core language to Cython as possible

so that maximum performance is achieved. Some functionality may be written in C

for even more speed.

#### PLEASE NOTE:



The special character: '$' can be put at the start of a string to instruct the

interpreter to lookup that word in the symbol table and retrieve its value.
